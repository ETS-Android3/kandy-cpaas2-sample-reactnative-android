## # Troubleshooting

1. Unable to load script make sure you are either running a metro server.

   `run command react-native start`

2. Could not connect to development server on android.

   * `Connect device`
   * `run command adb reverse tcp:8081 tcp:8081`

3.  react-native run-android ; SDK location not found, but it exists in the path.

   `Add path in environment`
